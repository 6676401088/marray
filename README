Marray: Fast Runtime-Flexible Multi-dimensional Arrays and Views in C++.

Copyright (c) 2011 by Bjoern Andres (bjoern@andres.sc).



I. Short Description

Marray is a single header file for fast multi-dimensional arrays and views
in C++. Unlike in other implementations such as boost MultiArray and
Blitz++, the dimension of Marray views and arrays can be set and changed at
runtime. Dimension is not a template parameter in Marray. Arrays and views
that have the same type of entries but different dimension are therefore of
the same C++ type (class). In conjunction with the comprehensive and
convenient Marray interface, this brings some of the flexibility known from
high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB to C++.


II. Features

- Multi-dimensional arrays and views whose dimension, shape, size and
  indexing order (first or last coordinate major order) can be set and
  changed at runtime
- Derived classes for matrices and vectors
- Access to entries via coordinates, scalar indices and STL-compliant
  random access iterators
- Arithmetic operators with type promotion and expression templates
- Support of exchangeable STL-compliant allocators
- Simple HDF5 inferface to load, save and exchange multi-dimensional data
  (see namespace marray::hdf5 in header include/marray/marray_hdf5.hxx)
- MIT License for worry-free use and distribution


III. Tutorial

- An introductory tutorial can be found at src/tutorial/tutorial.cxx


IV. Installation

Marray can be used without compiling and installing libraries. All you need to 
do is to copy the directory include/marray from the repository to your include 
directory. Even the single header file marray.hxx is sufficient if you do not 
need the HDF5 interface.

Nevertheless, Marray comes with files for CMake 2.6 or higher to build the unit
tests and tutorial code. It is recommended that you clone the repository to a 
local folder, e.g. ~/marray, make a build directory such as ~/marray-build, go
to that directory and call

> cmake ../marray
> make

and optionally

> make install

if you want CMake to copy the headers to your include directory. Call the unit
tests directly:

> test-marray
> test-marray-hdf5

No output is good output.
